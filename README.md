### Note

This is a sample list of features. Please update it to reflect the actual features of your project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React
* Create React App
* (Add other frontend libraries like React Router, Redux, Axios, Tailwind CSS, etc.)

### Backend

* (e.g., Node.js with Express.js)
* (e.g., MongoDB with Mongoose)
* (e.g., Socket.IO for real-time chat)
* (Add other backend technologies)

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* Node.js (v14 or newer recommended)
* npm or yarn
* Git
* (Add any other prerequisites like a database, e.g., MongoDB)

### Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the development environment for both the backend and frontend.

**1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the main project repository to your local machine.
*(Assuming the backend and frontend are in the same repository. If not, adjust accordingly.)*

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
```

**2. Backend Setup**

Navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, and set up your environment variables.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory (e.g., cd backend)
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create an environment file from the example
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add the necessary environment variables. This typically includes your database connection string, JWT secret, and any API keys.

```env
# Example .env for the backend
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
```

**3. Run the Backend Server**

Once the environment variables are set, you can start the backend server.

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5001`.

**4. Frontend Setup**

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and follow these steps.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory from the root project folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

You will need to create an environment file for the frontend to specify the backend API endpoint.

```bash
# Create a .env file in the /frontend directory
touch .env
```

Add the following to your new `/frontend/.env` file. This tells your React app where to send API requests.

```env
# The URL where your backend server is running
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

**5. Run the Frontend Development Server**

Now you can start the React development server.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts (Frontend)

In the `frontend` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
